# Etherium_Wallet_Python
The following code is an Ethereum web3 application that is backed by python code, using streamlet. The demo loads the client account and balance into the application using the information provided from Ganache (generates virtual Ethereum wallets for test net purposes). It then facilitates client to client transactions by first requesting the Ethereum hourly rate based on a fintech professional selected and executes the transaction through the Ethereum network blockchain.
